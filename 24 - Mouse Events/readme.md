## Lesson 23 - Canvas Events (Mouse Events)

### 1. Recall

__Key Events__

* Key events: keydown, keyup
* event object: `e.keyCode`

__HTML Mouse Events__

* Mouse events: click, doubleclick, mouseover, mouseout, mousedown, mouseup, mousemove


### 2. Canvas mouse events

The handling of mouse events for canvas is quite similar to key events. The difference is that we get the mouse location on the canvas by `e.clientX` and `e.clientY`. 

__Example 1__: print mouse location.

__Example 2__: a simple sketch board.


### 3. Practice

__Example 3__: spining swirl.
